# README

**This folder contains the files for Ian Nel's final project for the Programming with Data course.**

## Folders

The following sections will describe the structure and content of the folders herein.

### Data 

The data folder contains two subfolders: one for the raw data and one for the cleaned data. These datasets contain synthesized demographic information, as well as multiple, synthesized measures of distress tolerance and resilience. 

### Code 

The code folder contains two important files. The "Synthesizing_Data.Rmd" file contains the code that was used to synthesize the data in this project. Data were synthesized using the "synthpop" package in R in order to protect confidential data. The "hw04.FILE_TYPE" contains code for inputting, cleaning, and outputting data and associated plots.  

### Output 

The output folder contains a subfolder for figures that were generated from the code in the code folder.
