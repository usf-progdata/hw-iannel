# README

**This folder contains the files for Ian Nel's final project for the Programming with Data course.**

## Project Title: The Jingle-Jangle of Distress Tolerance and Resilience. 

### Project Description 



## Folders

The following sections will describe the structure and content of the folders herein.

### Data 

The "data"" folder contains two datasets and an associated data dictionary. These datasets contain (synthetic) demographic information, as well as multiple measures of distress tolerance, resilience, and psychopathology. The first ("DT-Res_synthetic.csv") is an archival dataset from the DEXTER (Dynamics of EXTERnalizing) Lab at USF that has been synthesized to protect confidentiality (see "Synthesizing_Data.Rmd" for germinal code). The second dataset ("DT-Res_synthetic_clean.csv") has been cleaned using the code contained in the "Final Project Code.Rmd". 

### Code 

The code folder contains two important files. The "Synthesizing_Data.Rmd" file contains the code that was used to synthesize the data for this study. Data were synthesized using the ```synthpop``` package in R in order to protect confidential data. The "Final Project Code.Rmd" contains code for inputting, wrangling, analyzing, visualizing, and outputting data.

### Output 

The output folder contains tables and figures that were generated from the code in the code folder.
