```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

csv = comma separated values; great format for exchanging data
Save excel files as csv before further processing because it's simpler

install.packages("here")
here package best way to refer to files - provides sequence of folders to follow; sned them entire R projects
here::here()

```{r}
here::here("data", "") #first argument is where is the path/file\

```

copy and paste column specifications from ```read_csv``` to col_types; read_csv guesses and does a pretty good job; saves time so you don't have to manually type column specifications

na = c("", "NA") defaults to 2 different things; NA = blank; NA = "NA"; can add more NA specifications (e.g., c("","NA",-999))

recursive = make all of the necessary folders along the way
