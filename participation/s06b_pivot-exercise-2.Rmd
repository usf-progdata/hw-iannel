You're working on a longitudinal study of parent-child relationships.
You have collected data from 500 families over 2 waves.
In each wave, both the child and parent completed measures of **communication behavior** and **relationship satisfaction**. 

```{r}
family %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```

1. Reshape the dataset to a "longer" format.

  - Make each row **1 score**
  - Have columns for *family_id*, *family_member*, *wave*, *scale*, and *score*.

```{r}
family_longest <- family %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -family_id,
               names_to = c("wave", "scale", "family_member"),
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "score")

print(family_longest)
```

2. Reshape the dataset to a "longer" format.

  - Make each row **1 person**
  - Have columns for *family_id*, *family_member*, *wave*, *comm*, and *satis*.

```{r}
family_long <- family %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -family_id,
               names_to = c("wave", ".value", "family_member"), #.value takes each unique entry and creates a new column for them
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "score")

print(family_long)
```

3. Some families are missing wave 2 data for parent, child, or both. 
   Which families are missing wave 2 data for at least one person?

```{r}
family %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -family_id,
               names_to = c(".value", "scale", "family_member"),
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "score") %>% 
  filter(is.na(w2)) %>%  #is.na checks if missing 
  select(family_id) %>% 
  unique() 
  
```

Question: Is is easier to easier to find the missing data in the wide or long format?
I think it's harder to find in long format
