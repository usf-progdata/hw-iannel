# converting between data.frame and tibble

## data.frame (base R)
psychTools::bfi

## tibble (tibble/tidyverse) #tidyverse allows to use tibbles instead of data frames; make sure multiple columns dont have same name; There are two main differences in the usage of a data frame vs a tibble: printing, and subsetting.


##Tibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. This makes it much easier to work with large data. In addition to its name, each column reports its type, a nice feature borrowed from str(): 
as_tibble(psychTools::bfi) #drops out rownames automatically
as_tibble(psychTools::bfi, rownames = ".id") #adds rownames argument 

###same thing 
psychTools::bfi %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = ".id") %>% 
  as_tibble()
  

dat_bfi <- as_tibble(dat_bfi)

print(dat_bfi, n = 30)

## tibbles are nice, but some packages (e.g., lavaan) don't play well with them
## In that case, convert back to data.frame
as.data.frame(dat_bfi)

# recode()

# Remember how mutate() and summary() have the form:
#   mutate(.data, new_column = computation)
#
# recode() is backwards:
#   recode(.x, old = new)

dat_bfi %>%

    gender = recode(gender, "1" = "man", "2" = "female")

## note that for numeric values, you need to wrap them in "quotes" or `backticks`
## That's not necessary for character values

## Let's say we want just "HS or less" versus "more than HS"
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    education = recode(education, "1" = "HS", "2" = "HS", .default = "More than HS")
  ) %>%
  select(.id, gender, education)

## let's say college vs. not college

  mutate(
    education = recode(education, "4" = "College", "5" = "College", .default = "Noncollege")
    ) %>% 
  select(.id, gender, education)
  

## Let's say we want to convert NA values to an explict value

# Now you try:

## 1. Use the psychTools::bfi (or psych::bfi) data

psychTools::bfi

## 2. Recode gender to 'man', 'women', '(no response)'

psychTools::bfi %>%
  mutate(
    gender = recode(gender, "1" = "man", "2" = "women", .missing = "no response") #use .missing because .default is for actual values
  ) %>%
  select(gender) %>% 
  filter(gender == "no response")

## 3. Recode education to "Some HS", "HS", "Some College", "College", "Graduate degree", "(no response)"


psychTools::bfi %>%
  mutate(
    education = recode(education, "1" = "Some HS", "2" = "HS", "3" = "Some College", "4" = "College", "5" = "Graduate degree", .missing = "(no response)")
  ) %>%
  select(education)

## 4. Compute a new variable `hs_grad` with levels "no" and "yes"
psychTools::bfi %>%
  mutate(hs_grad = recode(education, "1" = "no", .default = "yes")
  ) %>% 
  select(education, hs_grad)

## 5. Reverse code the -1 items, as indicated in psychTools::bfi.dictionary or psych::bfi.key


#Ignore the code below- it doesn't work 
psychTools::bfi.dictionary %>% 
  filter(Keying == -1) %>% 
  reversed <- pull(Item) 

psychTools::bfi.dictionary %>%
  mutate(
    across(all_of(reversed), 
           ~ recode(.x, 7 - .x),
           .names = "{.col}r")
  ) %>% 
select(reversed)
